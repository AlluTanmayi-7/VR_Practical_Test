**Practical Test**
<br>
As per instructions room, interactive objects should be there and interactive object should trigger an action. So I designed the room using BLENDER. In that room, plant pots are the interactive objects and when we grab of(interactive) those pots, it will turn into another color(triggers an action) and when we release a pot, then it will turn into original color. 

Interactive Object - **Plant Pots**
